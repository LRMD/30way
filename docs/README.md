# Baltic Way memorial award

This repository contains the public ADIF logs and statistical information about the 30WAY comemmorative activity, carried on amateur radio bands during the week 34 of year 2019.

## What is this?

Three special call signs from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were active on amateur (ham) radio bands: ES30WAY, YL30WAY and LY30WAY. There were defined conditions, under which, for radio contacts with each of these stations, a special PDF diploma was issued automatically upon a request for a particular callsign. The claim can be still made today on the award web site (see below)

## How did it work?

All three award stations did operate and maintained logs of the radio contacts. The logs were kept in ADIF format and uploaded to the web site www.clublog.org. The award web site interfaces with Clublog over an API to check whether enough contacts have been logged for a particular callsign. If the conditions are fullfilled, the award web site automatically generates a PDF award with the participants callsign and name (which is fetched from QRZ.COM over an API) and allows the requestor to download it.

## Historical background

The memorial award was announced by Eesti Raadioamatööride Ühing (ERAÜ), Latvijas Radio Amatieru Līga (LRAL) and Lietuvos Radijo Mėgėjų Draugija (LRMD) to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the Baltic Way – a peaceful protest against the Molotov – Ribbentrop pact signed on 23rd of August 1939, dividing the independent countries of Eastern Europe in spheres of influence between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.
